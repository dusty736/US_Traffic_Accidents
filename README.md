## Overview
Inspired from the [US Accidents 2016-2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), I will be looking into geographic and temporal realtionships in traffic related data.

# Analysis Questions

## Descriptive

Script: `R/step1_traffic_descriptive.R`

1. How many traffic accidents happen per year?
2. How many traffic accidents happen per month?
3. How many traffic accidents happen per day?
4. How many traffic accidents happen during rush hour?
5. How many traffic accidents happen during night?
6. How long is the average accident?
7. What time of day do most accidents happen?
8. How much distance is blocked by the average accident by severity?

## Exploratory

Script: `R/step2_traffic_exploratory.R`

1. Is there a correlation between temperatures and accident counts?
2. Is there a correlation between weather conditions and accident counts?
3. Is there a correlation between precipitation and accident counts?
4. Is there a correlation between visibility and accident counts?
5. Are there any temporal trends in the accident counts over time?
6. Is there a correlation between hour of the day and accident?
7. Is there a correlation between day of week and accident?

## Inferential

Script: `R/step3_traffic_inferential.R`

1. Is rush hour associate with higher rates of accidents?
2. Are adverse weather conditions associated with higher rates of accidents?
3. Have accident rates changed pre and post pandemic?

## Predictive

Script: `R/step4_traffic_predictive.R`

1. Can we predict daily accident counts using weather conditions?
2. With these predictions can we predict average traffic wait times?
